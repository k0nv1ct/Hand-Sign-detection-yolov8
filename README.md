# American Hand Sign Detection using YOLOv8

This repository contains a project for American Hand Sign Detection using the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) object detection model. The model is trained on the RoboFlow ASL dataset, which consists of labeled images of American Sign Language (ASL) hand signs.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the RoboFlow ASL dataset. It includes a collection of images depicting different hand signs used in American Sign Language. Each image is labeled with bounding box coordinates and corresponding class labels, representing the hand sign present in the image.

## YOLOv8 Object Detection Model
The YOLOv8 model is a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm. It divides the input image into a grid and predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities for each grid cell. It uses anchor boxes to improve the accuracy of bounding box predictions and applies convolutional layers to extract relevant features from the input image.

The YOLOv8 model is implemented using the Darknet framework and is trained on the RoboFlow ASL dataset to detect hand signs in images.

## Workflow
The project workflow can be summarized as follows:

1. Data Preparation: The RoboFlow ASL dataset is downloaded and preprocessed to ensure it is in a suitable format for training the YOLOv8 model. This involves resizing the images, generating anchor boxes, and creating the necessary data structure for model training.

2. Model Configuration: The YOLOv8 model architecture and configuration files are set up. This includes defining the network architecture, specifying the anchor box sizes, setting hyperparameters, and configuring the training parameters.

3. Training: The YOLOv8 model is trained on the preprocessed ASL dataset. During training, the model learns to detect hand signs by optimizing the network weights based on the provided labeled examples.

4. Evaluation: The trained model's performance is evaluated on a separate validation set or using cross-validation techniques. This helps assess the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and mean Average Precision (mAP) for hand sign detection.

5. Testing: The trained YOLOv8 model is tested on unseen images to detect hand signs. The model's predictions are compared against the ground truth labels to measure its accuracy and evaluate its real-world performance.

## Usage
To use the American Hand Sign Detection model with YOLOv8, follow these steps:

1. Set up the environment by installing the necessary dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

2. Download or clone the repository to your local machine.

3. Obtain the RoboFlow ASL dataset from the official source and preprocess it if necessary to ensure it is in a suitable format for YOLOv8 training.

4. Configure the YOLOv8 model architecture and hyperparameters in the Darknet framework. Adjust the configuration files according to your requirements.

5. Train the YOLOv8 model using the preprocessed ASL dataset and the Darknet framework. Monitor the training process and adjust hyperparameters as needed.

6. Evaluate the trained model's performance on a separate validation set or using cross-validation techniques. Assess the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and mean Average Precision (mAP) for hand sign detection.

7. Test the trained YOLOv8 model on unseen images containing hand signs. Compare the model's predictions against the ground truth labels to measure its accuracy and evaluate its real-world performance.
